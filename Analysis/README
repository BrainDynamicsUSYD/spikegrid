This folder currently contains two classification programs.  They can be compiled with `make`.


For Ubuntu, you will need to install F# - see http://fsharp.org/use/linux/

Classify.exe will take a sequence of `x1,y1;x2,y2;` coordinates with each time step on a new line and convert it to a sequence of wave center locations.

Analysis.exe will then calculate the MSD.

Some parameters may need to be changed at the top of the files.

easiest way to run this whole mess is to put your input files into input/... .  Also you need to create directories `data` and `out`

Running ./parallel.sh will call both programs correctly and put the output into out.

You can then use msdplot.m to plot everything on a log-log scale in matlab
