* TODO More types of spike
** TODO Delay and instantaneous spike
   
* TODO Error checking of input from matlab
** TODO Most important - single versus double precision compute floats
** TODO Secondary - any more error checking

* TODO Different maximum timescales for inhib + excit
  Currently, inhibitory and excitatory neurons share the same cap.
  It would probably be good for perf if they were different.
  In particular, it would be really good to reduce inhib timecourse
  as that has more effect on perf than excit timecourse

  
* DONE Allow for saving other arrays to png files - it would be good to just take in an outputtable, like matlab does
