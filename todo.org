* TODO [#C] More types of spike
** TODO Delay and instantaneous spike
   
* TODO [#A] Error checking of input from matlab
** TODO Most important - single versus double precision compute floats
** TODO Secondary - any more error checking

* TODO [#B] Different maximum timescales for inhib + excit in single-layer model
  Currently, inhibitory and excitatory neurons share the same cap.
  It would probably be good for perf if they were different.
  In particular, it would be really good to reduce inhib timecourse
  as that has more effect on perf than excit timecourse

* TODO [#A] Subthreshold wave
** DONE global
   CLOSED: [2014-05-06 Tue 15:41]
** TODO travelling
   
* TODO [#B] Double layer structure
** DONE Basic implementation
   CLOSED: [2014-05-13 Tue 12:04]
** DONE coupling between layers
   CLOSED: [2014-05-13 Tue 12:04]
** TODO Inhib layer has lower density
   
* TODO [#A] Allow picking a layer to sweep over in the dual-layer model
* TODO [#A] sweep is broken - need to encode which parameter object to sweep over
* TODO [#B] Optimise evolvept and evolvept_stdp for the case when only inhib/excite present in a layer
* TODO [#B] Optimise evolvept and evolvept_STDP to elegantly skip over zero entries in the coupling matrix
* TODO [#B] Addspikes should take the layer argument as const
  currently, this is restricted by the STD function - could be improved
  
* TODO [#A] Figure out how te get min and max values of outputtabbles and return them to matlab

* TODO [#C] estimate walltime + mem usage in yossarian.c
  
* TODO [#B] compiler does not warn on missing elements in parameters.h
  

* DONE Allow for saving other arrays to png files - it would be good to just take in an outputtable, like matlab does
  CLOSED: [2014-05-09 Fri 17:54]
* DONE Fix setup for dual layer
  CLOSED: [2014-05-09 Fri 15:36]
* DONE Create an input parameters struct to handle dual layer
  CLOSED: [2014-05-09 Fri 17:55]
* DONE remove STD_parameters from STD_data
